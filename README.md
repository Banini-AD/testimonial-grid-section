## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

This project pushed me to the edge in learning a new css pre-prcessor like Sass. I also helped me go in depth in building flexible layout. I learnt new and facinating things about the flexbox and the grid layouts.

Here's a Sass I'm proud of,

```scss
@mixin display-flex ($flex-direction, $justify-contents, $align-items) {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: $flex-direction;
    justify-content: $justify-contents;
    align-items: $align-items; 
} 
```

 I'm still learning Sass, but this is still Sass code I'm so proud of.


### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more on building flexible layouts. Getting to know more about how to let my browser do the heavy lifting in order to create fluid layouts without any hustle. Thus making my life easier and making my website more robust and responsive. I also want to improve on my Sass journey (i.e learn more about it) in order to get the hang of it. I want to write good Sass codes in order to leverag its power to my advantage.


### Useful resources

- [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This article by Josh really explained CSS Grid in details. With some cool features like the perspective view, and on-site code playground, I had a clear picture of what what css grid is all about and I also got a little bit of a hands-on experience on the page. I'd reccommend His articles to any new developer out there.

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This fun game helped me put my css flexbox knowledge to the test. I'd recomend this to anyone who thinks they know their stuff (Flexbox).

- [Learn Sass By freeCodeCamp on Youtube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=35s&pp=ygUKbGVhcm4gc2Fzcw%3D%3D) - This lengthy yet helpful YouTube tutorial provided the exposure I needed to get started with Sass. It offered detailed information on how to set it up, as well as insights on how and why to use it. The best part was that it demonstrated Sass in a real-world project, allowing us to see how it functions in actual applications.
